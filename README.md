# kashinbol
silly test game using P5.js libraries

Play it here https://cbriones.github.io/kashinbol/

How to Play: click accelerates the ball upwards. Try to catch as many red balls as you can.


Pending:
      add possibility of achieving records (most eats in a fixed amount of time, etc.)
      adding a new mode... energy going down to zero (game over)... try to eat new balls to recover it.
